# DUPLICATE NOTICE

This component is a DUPLICATE of the canonical two-stage optimizer at:
`components/cognitive_architecture/optimization/two_stage_optimizer.py`

## Status
- **Catalog Entry**: Only cognitive_architecture version is listed
- **Action**: This directory may be removed in a future cleanup
- **Migration**: Use the canonical path for new code

## Differences
- This version: Modular (separate constraints.py, objectives.py, optimizer.py)
- Canonical: Single-file implementation

Consider merging useful modular patterns into the canonical version before deletion.
